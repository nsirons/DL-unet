Reproducibility Project: U-Net
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository includes an Ipython notebook written by Group 35 for the reproducibility project in the course of Deep Learning (CS4240), accademic year 2019-2020, TU Delft.
In the notebook we go throught the original paper ["U-Net: Convolutional Networks for Biomedical Segmentation"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.04597.pdf) explaining the steps we followed to reproduce the method presented and, particularly, the results presented in table 2 and the pixel error of the U-Net reported in table 1.

Our goal is a full reproduction of the considered paper: the implementation of the method explained was caaried out without using the pre-existing code, made available by the authors.
In the notebook we explain step by step the assumpions we made and our choices and, in the end, we present the results we obtained: ....CONCLUSION: REPRODUCIBLE OR NOT.......
